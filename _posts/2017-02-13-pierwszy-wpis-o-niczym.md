It’s very crucial to have minimum HTTP request on your site. As a WordPress optimization goal, every blogger should be concern on how their blog loads and user behavior. More HTTP requests means more contents and hence longer page load time.

Google recently has factored page loading time into their search result page. If your site loads fast then there is a high possibility that it will appear first in Google Search page.

Simply put below content to your theme’s <code>functions.php</code> file and it will stop loading <code>wp-embed.min.js</code> into your site’s footer.
